# Crossmint coding challenge
Welcome to our Crossmint coding challenge, in which you will help us mint a new megaverse into existence!

Megaverses are 2D spaces comprised of combinations of different astral objects: 🪐POLYanets with 🌙SOLoons around them and ☄comETHs floating around.

Your job as the master of the megaverse will be to create one with some given parameters and shapes. You will use a megaverse creator API to help you with such legendary quest.

The challenge is composed of 2 phases. In the first one you will learn how to interact with the API and create some 🪐POLYanets and validate them. In the second one you will create a bigger megaverse with some peculiar shape.
 ## Phase 1: Do a 🪐POLYanet cross
In this phase you will use the megaverse service API to create 🪐POLYanets forming an X-shape like the following:

 ## Phase 2: Crossmint logo. With 🌙SOLoons and ☄comETHs!
In this second phase, you will have to build another megaverse… including the shape of our logo!

This new map has some other entities as well: 🌙SOLoons and ☄comETHs.

🌙SOLoons can only be adjacent to a 🪐POLYanet, and they can have a variety of colors.
☄comETHs can go alone in the universe, but they have a direction they’re facing.
You can see their specifications and APIs on the same Docs.


This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.0.5.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
